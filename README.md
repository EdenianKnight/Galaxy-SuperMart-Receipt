# 🛒 Shopping Receipt - HTML Table Practice

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This project teaches you how to create **tables** in HTML! Tables are used to organize information in rows and columns, just like a shopping receipt.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Learn how to use the `<table>` tag
- Understand table parts: `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>`
- Practice using `<tr>` (table row), `<th>` (table header), and `<td>` (table data)
- Make your table colorful with simple CSS!

## 📁 Files in This Project

- **index.html** - The main HTML file with our shopping receipt
- **table.css** - The CSS file that adds colors and makes it pretty

## 🏗️ HTML Table Structure

Here's what each part of a table does:

```markdown
<table>           ← The whole table
  <thead>         ← The header section (top of table)
    <tr>          ← A row
      <th>        ← Header cell (bold text)
  <tbody>         ← The body section (main content)
    <tr>          ← A row
      <td>        ← Regular cell (normal text)
  <tfoot>         ← The footer section (bottom of table)
```

## 🎨 Fun Things to Try!

### Change Colors

Open `table.css` and try changing these colors:

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;  /* Try: pink, lavender, lightyellow */
}

thead {
    background-color: lightgreen;  /* Try: lightcoral, skyblue, gold */
}

caption {
    background-color: orange;  /* Try: purple, red, green */
}
```

### Make Borders Bigger or Smaller

```css
border: 2px solid blue;  /* Try: 5px for thicker, 1px for thinner */
```

### Change the Store Name Size

```css
font-size: xxx-large;  /* Try: xx-large, x-large, large */
```

## 🌈 Color Names You Can Use

Here are some fun color names to try:

- `red`, `blue`, `green`, `yellow`, `orange`, `purple`, `pink`
- `lightblue`, `lightgreen`, `lightyellow`, `lightpink`, `lightcoral`
- `skyblue`, `gold`, `tomato`, `violet`, `lime`, `coral`
- `hotpink`, `deepskyblue`, `springgreen`, `salmon`

## 🎓 Challenge Activities

### Easy 🟢

1. Change the background color of the page
2. Make the borders a different color
3. Add your own item to the shopping list

### Medium 🟡

1. Change all the colors to your favorite colors
2. Make the caption text bigger
3. Add more padding to make cells bigger

### Hard 🔴

1. Create a new table with different items
2. Add a new column (like "Discount")
3. Make every other row a different color

## 💡 Tips

- Always close your tags! `<table>` needs `</table>`
- Use `<th>` for headers (they're bold automatically!)
- Use `<td>` for regular information
- Each `<tr>` is a new row
- Put all your cells inside rows

## 🚀 How to View Your Receipt

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. See your colorful shopping receipt!
3. Make changes in the files
4. Refresh the browser to see your changes

## 🎉 Remember

- HTML is for structure (the skeleton)
- CSS is for style (the colors and design)
- Have fun experimenting!
- There are no mistakes, only experiments! 🧪
